# US vs UK Nutrition Label Analysis

Welcome to the **US vs UK Nutrition Label Analysis** project! This interactive webpage compares the nutritional labeling standards of the United States and the United Kingdom, highlighting their design, structure, and consumer accessibility. Created by Akash Sriram, this project leverages modern web technologies to provide an engaging and educational experience.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes the differences between the US and UK nutrition labels, focusing on:
- **US Nutrition Label**: Meticulously designed for clarity and visual hierarchy, adhering to FDA guidelines with structured typography (e.g., Helvetica, Franklin Gothic).
- **UK Nutrition Label**: Prioritizes accessibility and consumer choice with a flexible design, featuring a voluntary traffic light system for quick health cues.

The webpage includes interactive elements, animations, and a theme toggle to enhance user engagement.

## Features

- **Comparative Layout**: Side-by-side display of US and UK nutrition labels with detailed breakdowns.
- **Interactive Icons**: Clickable icons linked to specific nutritional information sections.
- **Animated Transitions**: Text sections fade in and slide up as they enter the viewport (using Intersection Observer).
- **Background Accents**: Subtle hexagonal patterns add depth to the design.
- **Responsive Typography**: Font sizes scale dynamically across devices using `clamp()`.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light themes with a sun/moon icon.
- **Tooltips**: Hover over icons to see contextual information.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling, animations, and responsive design.
